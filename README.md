# The helicopter game
The Helicopter Game is very simple. The player has to manoeuvre the helicopter in the deep cave to avoid the obstacle, crashing in the cave will result in game over. The player also has to collect fuel as much as possible. Failed to do so, the helicopter will not be able to fly and eventually crash.
The further the player travel, the higher the score. Player can set a high score record if he/she beat the previous high score holder, the high score record will be stored inside the file.
To ensure player fresh experience each play through, the cave have been made to be created randomly every single time. The game will become more and more difficult as the player wander deeper into the cave. The helicopter velocity will become faster, the cave creation gradient (up and downs) will become more aggressive, the cave will become narrow in size as the player travel further.
